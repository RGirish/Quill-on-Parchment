<p>Jim was lying on the ground in the corner of the room shaking from head to toe. A machine was whirring at the centre emitting out a faint white light. His eyes were looking at the machine expectantly hoping and praying for some miracle. He seemed desperate. Tools and other fancy looking gadgets and gizmos littered the floor. Suddenly he heard a noise somewhere far off. His heart beat started to soar. He had been expecting this ever since he set up camp here. He usually never stayed at the same place on consecutive nights but he had to for the past one week to execute his grand escape plan. He had chosen a random small house in the city to not attract too much attention. Yet it was inevitable that someone may break in. He heard the distinct sound of someone breaking open the front door. He clenched the iron rod firmly in his hand. The machine started becoming brighter and brighter. It seemed as if it was charging with power. He was afraid the brightness may betray his whereabouts. He frantically got up and placed one hand on the machine while trying to shield the light from escaping the room with his body. Any second now…he thought. He heard the footsteps creaking under the sound of something heavy. Then silence, it was like a lull before a storm. It was now or never. Everything happened in a fraction of a second. The door burst open, its weak lock giving away and something tall and bulky stood at the doorway. It was made of a metal exoskeleton, had glowing eyes and a poker face expression.</p><p>The year was 2087 A.D.  and Jim was somewhere on the outskirts of Ohio. The path breaking discoveries of his grandfather in the field of robotics had led to the tall object in front of him-the X80 Crusher. The world was not the same place anymore. The great U.S.A. was not so great anymore because the unthinkable had happened-the Olympus had fallen.</p><p>The anti-government elements were now in power. The U.S. government was merely surviving. The abundant availability of technology and most importantly, Grandpa Henry’s grave error had led to this. Jim Hexton was a CIA agent who was given the crucial job of going back into the past.</p><p>Although time travel was forbidden by the international bodies, the government had no choice, they were desperate. It had taken months of preparation for Jim to get to this point. He was careful, very careful. But somehow they have found him, do they know about his mission?</p><p>His mission was to travel to 12-1-2048(A.D.) and stop Dr. Henry Hexton from selling the X48 Metabots to the rebels and to explain to him the consequence of his action because Henry didn’t just give the rebels the robots but also the science of making them. What was so extraordinary about his invention was that the robots can be used as weapons. Further upgrades in the Metabots, made the rebels stronger and stronger. </p><p>The latest of them, the Crusher was staring at him with its glowing red eyes. It had the ability to crush human bones with its massive claws. So standing before it with a 2 feet long iron rod seemed pretty stupid. But Jim couldn’t find anything, more importantly he couldn’t think of anything. The X80 Crusher was slowly but surely moving towards him. The light in the machine was starting to glow brighter and brighter. He prayed desperately for the machine to start, but still there was no force field to suck him into the good old days. His hands were shaking as he held on to the cold iron rod. His mind was racing, thinking about all the different possibilities to escape from the red-eyed monster. Still no force field. Suddenly the robot charged towards him. Thanks to his quick reflexes, he rolled between the metal legs of the monster. The machine was glowing brighter still. Now he was far from the machine. He had to get near enough to it so that the field can suck him into it when it appeared. He spotted a laser gun which he had not noticed before at the corner of the room and suddenly an idea popped up in his grey cells. He quickly grabbed the laser gun but he was not quick enough, the Crusher stood over him. He shot the laser at its most vulnerable spot-near its metal neck. The mighty Crusher stumbled and fell down. But Jim knew that it would get up any at any moment, so he started praying for the force field to appear. His prayer was fortunately answered and he was sucked into 2048.</p><p>A blue light surrounded him and he found himself disintegrate particle by particle. He felt like he was being born again, coming out of the womb of time and space. He found himself before the laboratory door of Dr. Henry Hexton. He knocked and a rather young man who looked like Jim answered it. Suddenly Jim realized that the game was just beginning and he was all ready to play… </p><p></p>
