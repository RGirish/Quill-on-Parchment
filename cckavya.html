<p>Jim was lying on the ground in the corner of the room shaking from head to toe. A machine was whirring at the centre emitting out a faint white light. His eyes were looking at the machine expectantly hoping and praying for some miracle. He seemed desperate. Tools and other fancy looking gadgets and gizmos littered the floor. Suddenly he heard a noise somewhere far off. His heart beat started to soar. He had been expecting this ever since he set up camp here. He usually never stayed at the same place on consecutive nights but he had to for the past one week to execute his grand escape plan. He had chosen a random small house in the city to not attract too much attention. Yet it was inevitable that someone may break in. He heard the distinct sound of someone breaking open the front door. He clenched the iron rod firmly in his hand. The machine started becoming brighter and brighter. It seemed as if it was charging with power. He was afraid the brightness may betray his whereabouts. He frantically got up and placed one hand on the machine while trying to shield the light from escaping the room with his body. Any second now…he thought. He heard the footsteps creaking under the sound of something heavy. Then silence, it was like a lull before a storm. It was now or never. Everything happened in a fraction of a second. The door burst open, its weak lock giving away and something tall and bulky stood at the doorway. It was made of a metal exoskeleton, had glowing eyes and a poker face expression. Jim started, his feet automatically backed up against the wall behind him with the iron rod clutched in his sweaty palms. The creature turned its glowing ruby gaze towards him and advanced with thudding footsteps, while slowly drawing a sword from the sheath at its hip. The sound of metal against leather sent a shiver down Jim’s frame yet he held strong. The creature pointed its sword at him with the tip slightly piercing him through the many layers of clothing he wore.</p><p>‘Who are you?’ it screeched.</p><p>‘Jim…Jim Malters.’ He stuttered in response.</p><p>‘What are you doing on my property? Are you one of the Socerer’s Guild?’ it demanded, moving closer , its  foul  breath fuming over Jim’s face. </p><p>Silence followed the query.</p><p>‘Answer me!’ it screamed.</p><p>‘Wait!’ Jim said dropping the iron rod to raise his hands in defence. ‘I am a m-m-mortal. I am not from this land.’</p><p>The sword pierced him even deeper making him struggle to keep in his cry of pain.</p><p>‘And why should I believe you? No mortal has set foot in Lancastle since the war where most of them perished in battle. The ones who didn’t perish left the land cursing it. Why should I believe that you would be foolish enough to return?’ </p><p>‘Because I can free you.’ Jim challenged raising an eyebrow defiantly, ‘But first tell me who you are.’</p><p>The creature growled, the darkness making its eyes even more sinister, ‘I make the demands around here and you follow them.’</p><p>Jim sighed and reached into his pocket for a silver blade, the only thing that will harm a sorcerer, and made a small cut on his arm. When the skin didn’t burn like it would for a sorcerer the creature relieved the pressure of the sword pressing against his chest, making him sigh in relief.</p><p>‘My name is Paganini and I am a dragon.’ the creature exclaimed as if stating the obvious, ‘Why did you come here?’</p><p>‘I simply needed a place to rest my friend.’ Jim started his hand on the sword, slowly lowering it as he straightened up, ‘I am working on a machine that will take me back to my land. It brought me to Lancastle. I need a few ingredients to make it work again. I was procuring the last ingredient when I was spotted by the king’s guard. I’ve been on the run ever since. Your house looked abandoned so I took it to be the best hiding place. I shall leave now.’</p><p>‘Wait!’ Paganini stopped him, hand tight on his arm, ‘Who are you?’</p><p>Jim paused hesitant to answer him but he relented in the end. </p><p>‘I am a realm jumper.   I’ve been in pursuit of my family ever since I lost them during one of my exiles. I heard word that they were here, in Lancastle, but my lead was proven wrong. I need to move on to my next lead.’</p><p>Paganini appraised him silently, his eyes seeming to dim as if it softened with compassion. His fist relaxed and mouth tilted into a sad knowing smile. </p><p>‘Aye, I too know what it is to lose one’s family. I shall endeavour to help you mortal. </p><p>Jim looked in shock, his eyes widening in disbelief as tears of gratitude welled up in his eyes. He shook Paganini’s hand firmly, his expression solemn, ‘I owe you far more than a thanks, my friend.’</p><p>Paganini nodded looking at the machine that was emitting light, probably the same light that attracted him to the room, he inferred, ‘What is all this?’</p><p>‘This is the machine that helps me travel realms.’ Said Jim waving his hand at it with a flourish, ‘I have added all the ingredients required but one. I hoped it would work but alas! It seems that the times of miracles had passed when I had my laughter.’</p><p>Paganini thought of his own family, all of whom have been murdered by the wretched sorcerer including his little girl Lynna. </p><p>‘Whatever it is I shall procure it for you. But you have to take me along with you wherever you go next.’</p><p>Jim pondered on the request before accepting it, his smile wide. They both travelled far and wide for many weeks, until they finally came across what they were looking for-a unicorn hair. Jim and Paganini hurried back to the house to start the machine. Jim grabbed hold of the tools that were scattered across the floor and started working. The machine came to life with a bright white light which glowed brighter than before.  Jim turned to the dragon his face pensive. Paganini looked expectantly with an eyebrow raised.</p><p>‘I am sorry my friend.’ Jim apologized making Paganini wary but before he could ask him what was the matter, Jim as quick as the wind thrust his blade through the dragon, making Paganini’s eyes widen with the shock of betrayal.</p><p>‘The final ingredient!’ started Jim in a hoarse voice,’ A dragon’s heart.’</p><p>Paganini struggled until all life left him, the blade having been poisoned earlier. Jim forcibly cut out his friend’s heart, his own thudding a wild staccato in his chest as guilt ate him off.</p><p>‘I am truly sorry Paganini. I hope you are reunited with your family.’ he whispered, the bloody heart clutched in his trembling hands and then he threw it into the void of the machine.</p><p>He gave one last look to his companion before closing his eyes, warding his emotions against the quickly harbouring guilt, before jumping into the void. </p><p>‘It was all for my family.’ he justified to no one.       </p><p></p>
