Madras in 375 words. What comes to my mind, when I think of Madras? As I leaf through the pages of my memory album, these are a few of the snapshots of Madras that rush to the forefront. 
Snapshot 1: Kapaleeswarar temple in Mylapore, in all its ancient glory. The impressive deities that draw large crowds of devotees. The temple tank around which a multitude of shops sell interesting knick-knacks. The “Agra haram” with its quaint houses and narrow streets. A few minutes away, Saint Thomas church in Santhome, with its lovely stained glass pictures and tomb of apostle St. Thomas. The famous Thousand Lights Mosque at Anna Salai, an exhilarating structure with multi domes and spearing minarets. Madras, a city of religious harmony. 
Snapshot 2: Marina beach, with the waves beating on the sands. Vendors of various goodies and commodities dotting the landscape. People sitting on the sands, chattering merrily, munching peanuts while gypsy women try to tempt them to have their palms read. Children digging trenches, building castles, flying kites, playing cricket, tearing around on the soft sand. Men, women and children, wading in the waves, with shrieks of laughter as the waves rise up to the challenge of keeping them entertained. “Sundal”, “Maangai”, “Delhi appalam”, and delicious beach “Sonpapdi”. Madras, a city of scenic splendor. 
Snapshot 3: The most blessed and cursed of the vehicles on the road, the ubiquitous auto rickshaws. Flagging down an auto to go to a hitherto unvisited place. The friendly auto driver discusses the merits and de-merits of various routes, gives tips on various topics and without missing a beat, demands Fifty Rupees above the meter charge. The PTC buses, the cars, the bikes, plying the roads, with cheerful abandon, squeezing into gaps in the traffic with a loud honking of horns. Madras, a city of charming chaos. 
Snapshot 4: Murugan Idli, Grand Sweets, Saravana Bhavan, Sangeetha, Thalappakatti Biriyani, Madurai Appu – all these establishments serving food so typical of the state and catering to various palates, a veritable Garden of Eden for food lovers to explore. Madras, a city of tempting flavors. 
More images of Kacheepuram saris, Margazhi concerts, Agni nakshathiram, Ranganathan street and Central Station flood my memories. Madras, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of colors and patterns.

<p>After enjoying a surprisingly smooth drive from Chennai Central, I turn right from the signal after “Bodyguard” Muneeswaran temple into Anna Salai. After crossing the Periyar Bridge, somewhere near the office of ‘The Hindu’, I notice a new foot over-bridge. Curious, I park my car on an unusually empty Anna Salai and climb up the stairs of the foot over-bridge. The view from the top is enchanting. Suddenly there is a gentle, cool breeze bringing with it a salty tinge. Having lived eighteen years in Triplicane, right on the shores of the Marina, I could instantly relate it to the feel of the sea/beach. I reflexively turn to the left, to be spellbound by the view of the sea. It’s not just the view, it’s the sound of the waves that makes the moment magical! As if someone had cast a spell on me, I stood there motionless, enjoying the sight and sound of the bluish-grey sea. After a few minutes in a state of “nirvana”, as if someone reminded me of something more important, I move ahead. I keep walking on the foot over-bridge enjoying an aerial view of the majestic Presidency College, the statues of poets and leaders on the entire Marina stretch, IG’s office and the lighthouse. Wait, am I walking on a foot over-bridge or flying? I am not sure. Anyway, I keep walking (or flying?) until I see a flight of stairs again. I hurriedly climb down and find myself in Mandaveli, near the bus depot, to be precise! I am in a state of mind that can at the best be described as “confusingly shocked”. To add to it, my wife suddenly appears out of nowhere and tells me I am getting late to work and that I should wake up! I realize this was another dream going into my long list of “Madras dreams”. I’ve spent the last 14 years away from my hometown, Madras, in two different cities, but till date majority of my dreams have had their “plot” set in Madras. Funnily, I’ve had quite a few of my friends and acquaintances, who haven’t been to Chennai ever, appearing in those dreams, set in Chennai! Happy 375th birthday, Madras, you beauty! Miss you and love you!!</p>

<p>Chennai- flashes from the past. It has been sometime since my daughter requested me to write a post on Chennai for a blog entry. 
Yes, Namma Chennai. Time I went back to you. It has been close to two decades that I am not in close proximity with you. But for some reason, I miss you hugely. You have been a part of me for so many good years. You rule my heart wherever I am. I have been a sucker for nostalgia, as most of my posts would vouch for, but this one on Chennai is very special. The thought of Chennai floods my mind with memories in many colorful hues. Pondering on this post, memories of the times spent on the beach, Luz corner, Pondy Bazaar and Mylapore surges into mind. Needless to say, Mylapore reigns supreme, as my childhood years spent there was one of sheer fun and excitement. We stayed close to Mylapore behind Warren Road. Those days, life was one of simplicity. Festivals were celebrated with great gusto, but life was so plain and simple that it mostly revolved around your friends, neighbors and extended family- sans the trips to the movies, malls or fast food joints, as it is now. My weekends were always spent near the kapali temple. Friday evenings - the auspicious day for karpagambal, were spent with trips to the temple for a glimpse of the deity adorned in all splendor, shopping for the greens and veggies, walking across to Ambika’s for the weekly quota of snacks and savories. The sights and sound were abundant for a delightful eight year old to take in. Although these visits to Mylai found its place every week on our list, I never got tired of them and those happy pictures stayed with me forever. Even today, the streets of Mylapore take me on those nostalgic trips, reliving memories, smiles, laughs, spreading that infectious cheer of an eight year old in all awe, waiting for new surprises to unravel. Chennai would never cease to fascinate anyone who has experienced the pulse of the city. It has something to offer everyone, from the sober senior to the uber cool youth. With its bastion of magnificence, towering temple Gopurams, with its bright hues of soft, lustrous kancheepurams, timeless classical music concerts, and the effervescent tumbler davara filter coffee. My city never stops wooing people to her in her million unique ways. Talking of you, I can spend any number of hours stuck in the past; in your cozy arms .Everything remains the same. Chennai beckons me all the time - breathtakingly beautiful, rich in its deep-rooted cultural connections, wistful fragrance of malli poo. 
Madras, you are still the same. You imbibe the old and the new. You live there forever.. deep inside the cocoons of my heart…

Madras – The name has a weird connection with me. Well, not just with me but with every single person who lives here. Right from the steaming hot filter coffee that accompanies the Pongal and Vada of Rayar’s mess to the oozing beer in 10 Downing Street, Madras has it all. Name it, and you will get it here—this is the simple funda that of Madras. Having lived here for, one year shy of a quarter century, I have grown to love this place like how I love my mother. Waking up to the morning sun in the Marina beach to dozing off in the daintily lit Parthasarathy Temple streets, I literally find heaven in this place. This is a place where tradition meet trend. I witness Madisar-clad women drawing rangoli in front of their apartments while I jog around in my tracks. Also, this is the place where everyone is kith and kin. The street named “Pilliyar Koil Street” will abode Muslim tenants, while a street named Wallace Garden can have Brahmin occupants. Being in Madras, I learnt to celebrate Ramzan the way I celebrate Diwali, for I live in a place with Big Mosque at one end and Parthasarathy Temple in the other. Above all, for a foodie like me, Madras is indeed the second mother. When I feel like eating Gujarati food, all I do is to go to sow carpet. If I prefer Burmese, I go to Parrys, north Indian to Rajdhani, EA, South Indian to HSB, Mylapore. Not only food, but the place has a style of its own. Traditional saris in Rangachari to that tube top from Globus, Madras is a place to buy it all. Last but not the least, for every bookaholic; Madras is the place that you should definitely be in. Engineering to Erotica, Technical to Thriller, Fantasy to Feminism, name it and you will get it in the streets of Madras.  Madras gives you all, the satisfaction of the beach waves caressing your feet, being able to call strangers as Anna, Akka, Mama, machan (relative names). You can take a Madrasi out of Madras but you can never take Madras out of a Madrasi.

Madras was a place of fun and frolic every summer. Madras meant no homework and unrestricted ‘cartoon network’ time. My five year old brain usually lost count of the number of beaches in the city chasing after that racing crab, running away from me and the rowdy cousins. Using the electric train, just to get to the other end of the city used to blow my mind. For I was used to auto rickshaws for traversing the small city I lived in, which was just probably the size of Tambaram. The summer heat never bothered us when we played for hours together on the roads, although we fought to sleep in the only air conditioned room in the night. We would wait for the neighbor Brahmin thatha to finish his lunch and take a siesta, so that we could steal chikkus from his precious tree.  He would punish us by teaching incomprehensible slokhas all evening. We made friends with the street dog, which to our eyes was the prettiest and coolest dog. This used to be a routine irrespective of all the thrashing we got from our mothers, worried sick about the infections that the dog could be carrying. We would bathe in the small artificial pond near our house and try to domesticate small fishes which would later die in a water bucket.  A heartfelt and emotional funeral would be conducted every single time. 
Going out with our granddad and drinking paneer soda was a routine on those evenings we managed to evade the neighbor Brahmin thatha. Desserts after dinner meant small kulfis bought from the uncle in a turban. Every year the women in the house chose one day in May, usually a week day, to do shopping in T. Nagar. This meant spending the entire day in the overcrowded street and spending all of dad’s money in one day. It had its sweet moments too like getting that remote controlled car, numerous earrings, bangles, colorful bindis and more toys. The day ended with us gorging on huge crispy steamy pooris in one of the ‘Bhavans’. This was 15 years ago. My cousins and I meet seldom these days but the memories we have of those summers spent in the city never fails to put smile on our faces even today.
