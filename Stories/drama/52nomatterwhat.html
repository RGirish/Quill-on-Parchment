<h4 style="text-align:justify;font-family:Nyala;font-size:1.3em;color:#000;">

<p>It’s been a pleasant day. It’s almost 5 in the evening. I usually go for a walk at this time. But I gave it a rest today. My wife’s name is Lalitha. I guess she’s outside gossiping with her friends. Pfft. Typical woman, I should say. I can’t fathom what excitement these ladies find in digging into other people’s lives, often ending up spreading rumors about them. Anyway, I love her no matter what. I always have. We found each other on the second day of our college. And we found each other in love two months later. It’s been a lovely journey from there to here. Now we are 58 years old. We got married when we were 26. Whoa, that makes it 32 years of married life! I didn’t quite realize that until now. Am I not the luckiest guy in the world?! She’s a sweet caring woman. Like I said, I love her with all my life. But you know who I love beyond my life? Our son. Pratamesh. </p><p>Well, to put it in one sentence, he’s the sole reason why we live. We had him on the 3rd of April, 1984. You would have heard people say that the day your child was born would be the most precious day of your life. Well, you’ll have no idea how true that is, until you actually experience it. That moment, when the doctor comes to you when you’re probably pacing back and forth in the waiting room, and hands over your beautiful baby, it can’t be expressed in words. Every single cell in my body vibrated with positive energy. I never felt that rejuvenated. I wanted to spend every single minute of the rest of my life for him. With him. Take care of him. Be there for him in his ups and downs. Carry him on my shoulders through all of his endeavors. And to the best of my knowledge, I think I have done that to this day. </p><p>He was such a cutie pie in his early days. One interesting thing about Pratu is that he does things prematurely. For instance, what is the average age in which a baby rolls over? 3 to 4 months maybe? Pratu did that in just a month. He sat up when he was 6 months old, he started to crawl when he was 7 months old and I could just go on and on. Soon after he was born, I quit my job and started a business at home. Just so I could be with him all day. Every little thing he did, made me extremely proud. How I wish he was a little baby again! </p><p>I never liked being away from him. So much so that I cried like anything on his first day of school. Yes, it was me who cried. Not him. He was all happy and thrilled. I don’t know what I was thinking when I had that huge fight with Lallu about sending him to school. It took me quite a few days to be alright about that. This was my daily routine at that time- I take him to this local supermarket, go to the kids section, and he points at random things and I buy him every little thing that he points at. Just because I knew I couldn’t bear to look at the disappointment on his face if I refused. I wanted to spend every penny that I earned, for him.</p><p>Oh man, wasn’t he the gabbiest boy! He talked A LOT. It was so adorable to hear him talk, you know. I could probably listen to little Pratu talk all day long, and repeat it again the next day. And he was a very smart kid too. It was so unbelievable how he understood things so easily, how he grasped every minute detail. The kind of memory power that he had, was above par. He always outsmarted all the other kids. Be it academics, or sports, or the other extra-curricular activities or whatever, Pratu was always the first. Oh let me say it already! He’s the best. My son’s the best. Period. I’m so lucky that he’s my son. Now he’s all grown up. He’s not a kid anymore! He just turned 30 this April. He’s been working as a Senior Researcher in Intel Corporation and his office is just a few blocks away from here! </p><p>Apart from computers and technology, Pratu was also very fond of cricket. He just didn’t like it. He was passionate about it. I encouraged him all the way from buying his first cricket bat when he was 8 or so, to him getting selected for the State Team when he was 16. I still remember the day when he won his first cricket match as the captain. He was 13. He played for the under-15 team in the district. Both of us were there at the stadium to cheer him up. And he was brilliant at the game. He was all over the newspapers the next day. And as always I was the proud dad. When he was around 18, he had to make a choice. It was either cricket or computers. He eventually chose computers over cricket. That was a tough decision for him. Making this decision really worried him a lot I guess. He spent most of his time alone back then, always brooding about something.</p><p>When he was younger, he spent a lot of time with me than his mother. Right from his babyhood, I needed to be with him all the time. It was me who needed to carry him to places when he was a kid. Not his mother. Everyone was surprised at how the baby was more inclined to his father than his mother! When he got older, it was still the same. We hung out all the time. We used to jog together every morning, we went for movies together, we went for road trips, and we were like the best buddies ever. </p><p>All this affinity that he had towards me turned to his friends during his adolescence. Like all kids, as he grew up, as he entered his teenage, he kind of distanced himself from the two of us. We didn’t bother about that at all. We knew he loved us. And I guess he knew we loved him too. He was always a gregarious person. He never liked solitude. He always had a bunch of friends around him. He was the kind of person who loves being in a gang. He almost always brought his friends home after school, and Lallu cooked food for all of them. Those kids even called us the ‘coolest parents ever’. We were never against his will to do anything, as long as it was right. We gave him all the freedom one could have and I should say, he was a very good kid as well. He never misused the freedom he had. We let him enjoy his teenage to the fullest! </p><p>I really wish I spent more time with him during that period. During his teenage. When he started distancing himself from us, was a very hard time for me. When he was a kid, he was always with me. I was always with him. But all that just reversed. It was a painful couple of years for me. Though we were in the same house, we hardly talked to each other. I started missing him. He was right in front of my eyes. But he was not with me. I guess that’s how it is for all parents with teenage kids. I was always blindly optimistic. I always had hope that it’d all get better as time passed. I had hope that he’d understand what I felt. After he completed his bachelor’s degree, he wanted to go to Canada to pursue his Master’s Degree. He got admitted there and he studied for two years. And after that, he got this job in Intel and he had to move back here. But when he came back, he was totally different. He wasn’t the Pratu I knew. Even though he didn’t let us participate much in his teenage life, he loved us and cared about us then. But as he grew older, everything started to change. He started blaming us for everything that went wrong with him. He shouted at us almost daily for silly reasons. He was never the same after he came back. It was almost like he started hating us. </p><p>He then sent us here, to Lions Old Age home. It’s been three years now since we came here. He said we were too old to be taken care of. He said he didn’t have the time to take care of us anymore. </p><p>They don’t let us go outside the premises. I really wish he comes here soon. It’s been more than two years since we saw him the last time. </p><p></p>
