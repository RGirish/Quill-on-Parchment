<h4 style="text-align:justify;font-family:Nyala;font-size:1.3em;color:#000;">

<p>On a pleasant Friday night, Max and Melissa Smith were heading back from an Italian restaurant after celebrating their second anniversary. Except for the fact that some person at the restaurant had spotted the gun Max was carrying, and had threatened to call the police, before max had to calm him down by showing his police badge, and which miffed Melissa, the night had been amazing. Nevertheless, that incident led to a small argument. “How many times do I have to tell you to not bring that stupid gun of yours when we are out?” asked a frustrated Melissa. “And how many times do I have to,” began Max, trying to justify bringing his gun with him yet again, but deciding to drop the argument, instead said, “You know what? You are right. I'm sorry. My bad. Let’s not ruin a wonderful night, alright?” The previous night, Melissa had given him the best news of his life; the best news of both of their lives. Soon, there was going to be a third member in their family. He did not want to upset her for any reason. They later kissed and made up.
</p><p>
</p><p>It was eleven, and Max stopped the car at a gas station. They got down and Melissa decided to get cupcakes at the store. While Max was busy filling up his car with gas, a heavy-looking young man got out of a car with three others, and entered the store. The next few moments of his life happened so fast and were so shocking, that he could not think. One of these thugs, as an initiation test, sliced Melissa’s throat with a dagger. Max, coming back to his senses, took his gun out, ran after the thug, and shot his hand. But the man had run into the car, which drove off, before Max could catch him.
</p><p>
</p><p>Max’s whole world seemed to be turning bizarrely twisted. He did not know what to do as he went inside the store and knelt beside Melissa, who was lying down in a pool of blood. He started sobbing with her head on his lap, unable to wrap his head around what had taken place. Somebody in the store called 911. As she lay there, Melissa grasped some air and said, “You were right about the gun. I'm sorry!” She breathed her last, before her heart stopped beating, and her skin turned cold and pale. That night, two lives were lost. Soon after, Max developed severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
</p><p>
</p><p>Few weeks passed by and Max's physical health started to deteriorate too. He was granted a leave of absence from the department because of his unstable mental conditions and was given time to recuperate. His doctor had prescribed him a new type of pills and had warned him about something, but that warning did not seem to be important; nothing really was anymore. His way of living had entirely changed after that day. He used to sleep for over ten hours and used to aimlessly wander around his neighborhood doing nothing during the day. He had started to visit a shrink thrice a week.
</p><p>
</p><p>It was a Thursday night and Max went to bed exhausted. He immediately fell into deep sleep. That night Max dreamt something: he was walking aimlessly down the road behind his apartment. While he was walking down the road, he saw a gang of thugs smoking at a corner, and then taking off in the same car the thugs who killed his wife were in. They drove right past him. His chest tightened, his face and neck started burning, and he started sweating and nauseating. He was having a panic attack, and he collapsed on the ground. He got up after a few seconds, but everything after that was a blur.
</p><p>
</p><p>Max woke up the next morning feeling exhausted, which was unusual, considering he had slept for over ten hours. He found the dream to be very strange too, as he had seen that same car, and probably the same gang that killed his wife, but didn’t put much thought into it, brushing it off as something post-traumatic. His colleagues were busy trying to find this group of thugs to take them in. He didn’t socialize much after his wife's incident, and became a recluse, interacting with only his shrink. He ended up watching videos of him and his wife that evening.
</p><p>
</p><p>That night, as usual, he took two of the pills and went to bed. He dreamt that night too. Strangely, it was a similar one: he was once again walking aimlessly down the road, but this time he had his gun with him. As he was passing by an alley, he heard a woman screaming. She was being mugged. Briefly, his wife’s face flashed in front of him, and he saw her throat being sliced. He picked up the gun and pointed at him, and did what he had to do the night his wife died, what he always wanted to do: he pulled the trigger. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Max woke up the next day with trembling hands and an elevated heartbeat. He was exhausted again. There was something heavy in his pocket - his gun. With trembling hands, he kept it away. He took two of those pills again. It was helping him, or so he thought. He was very much perturbed about what felt like a dream to him, a very strange one. He did not just dismiss it this time. As it was Saturday, the day to meet his shrink, he decided to discuss this with her. During his session with her, he told everything. His exhaustion even after over ten hours of sleep, his weird dreams of seeing the thugs who killed his wife, and killing one of the thugs. She was worried too. It was something serious. She asked him to visit his doctor immediately.
</p><p> 
</p><p>When he arrived at the parking lot after meeting his shrink, he was shocked to see his car. It was totally wrecked, and on the wall beside it was written the words in bright red, “You're next.” He didn’t understand what was going on. It made no sense at all. Who would do this? Why would they do this? There was so much running through his mind. He did not remain at the parking lot for long. He took off from the place. He was walking down the street back to his house, trying to wrap his head around all the bizarre events that was taking place lately. He went home, took the pills and threw himself on his couch. Yet again, he dreamt, and found himself walking down the road again. But this time, he was not alone. He heard multiple foot steps behind him. As the sound of the footsteps gradually amplified, he turned and saw the men who had killed his wife. He tried to reach for his gun but he wasn’t carrying it. They closed in on him, and he was pulled into an alley. He was thrown on the ground, and one the thugs whispered, “This is for what you did to our boy,” before he pierced a knife right into Max’s chest. Suddenly, he woke up. He was lying in that alley, in a pool of blood, with unbearable pain in his chest, screaming loudly. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Everything was so confusing. The pain was real, the blood was real. Suddenly, at this moment, Max remembered what his doctor had warned him about - overdose of the pill. He was instructed to take one at a time, but he was taking two. One of the effects of overdose of the pill was sleep walking. The events that used to take place in his weird dreams were all real. The reason he was so exhausted right after waking up was because he wasn’t actually sleeping, but sleep walking. The reason his hands were trembling when he woke up was because he had actually shot a man, whose friends had wrecked his car. It was the same gang that had killed his wife. The same gang that stabbed him in the chest. Everything became clear to him now. 
</p><p>
</p><p>He was losing a lot of blood. There was no way he could make it out of this, and he knew it. But, he was happy. Happy because he had killed his wife's killer. Happy because he was finally being re-united with her. 
</p><p></p>
