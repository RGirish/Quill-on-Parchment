<p>He was strapped to a chair by Duct tape and the place was familiar. His Theatre.</p><p></p><p>His body felt weak and he was having difficulty breathing.</p><p></p><p>His face was swollen like a balloon. He was setting into anaphylactic shock.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was dropping in and out. He was barely able to keep up with gravity of the events that was taking place before him.</p><p></p><p>He had underestimated the enemy's skill and strength.</p><p></p><p>He was slowly falling into the limbo of his own mind.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this blunder would be fatal to him.</p><p></p><p>It was true. His whole life was flashing before him. He saw everything clearly like a cinema scope.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>His Family, His School life, His college life and friends from there.</p><p></p><p>He also remembered the most important event of his life, that led ultimately up to this incident.</p><p></p><p>It was a rainy day, but the night was silent. But deep between the silences was the echoes of a young woman who was screaming for her dear life.</p><p></p><p>Every single word Anonyma uttered was etched in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He was lying on the floor of the moving vehicle crippled by the blows from the very men whom he had believed to be good Samaritans few minutes ago.</p><p></p><p>In an almost empty bus Anonyma and Sykopa were leaving home from his doctor's appointment.</p><p></p><p>Sykopa met Anonyma during his college freshman year. They instantly became best buddies.</p><p></p><p>He tried to get up from the floor of the bus. But he was beat up again by the three ruffians.</p><p></p><p>He knew all of them had alcohol in their brains and veins.</p><p></p><p>They let him bleed and attended the girl sprawling on the floor in pain. Sykopa, unable to move from the mind numbing pain, was forced to watch Anonyma being raped brutally by those men.</p><p></p><p>His soul was shouting out to the Gods for help, but in vain.</p><p></p><p>He was seeing blood now. Not his own but, hers.</p><p></p><p>He mustered all his strength and got up and hit the youngest of the group in his face. He dodged the next strike and countered Sykopa with a metal rod.</p><p></p><p>The rod was bloody even before it hit him. He tried his best to block but he was hit rapidly and thrown out of the moving bus.</p><p></p><p>As he lay spread eagle on the muddy road, he had no strength to move, barely to breath.</p><p></p><p>All he could do was give out a muffled cry of agony and pain.</p><p></p><p>He lost his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>He came back to reality. The situation was a Deja vu -feeling helpless, weak and out strengthened.</p><p></p><p>The scar on his nemesis face reminded him of Anonyma.</p><p></p><p>But he was satisfied with himself, with what he had done, with his murders.</p><p></p><p>Almost after 5 years later he never imagined he would be caught by the same person who had initiated the unnatural chain of events.</p><p></p><p>His body was bleeding from various places from the encounter he had before being overpowered.</p><p></p><p>He was smiling with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Darkness again</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>He woke up from his coma 13 days after the event. The culprits had escaped and they were not apprehended. By then Anonyma had died. And the city was in flames, flames of revolt and uprising.</p><p></p><p>His inner self was restless for revenge.</p><p></p><p>8 months later he found one person of the group in a bar.</p><p></p><p>He was half-drunk and he did not recognize Sykopa.</p><p></p><p>Sy escorted him to his location.</p><p></p><p>When the drunkard woke up he found himself upside down naked.</p><p></p><p> An inch long hook was pierced through his foot, by which he was hanging.</p><p></p><p>He was bleeding slowly from the surgically cut slits in his body. Eventually his heart would run dry of blood. The drunkard was administered warfarin to prevent coagulation.</p><p></p><p>Sykopa took a scalpel and began to slowly etch something on his Chest.</p><p></p><p>Drunkard was able to do nothing but shout in pain.</p><p></p><p>But Sy knew better than that, that nobody would hear a thing from the 11th floor recording theatre.</p><p></p><p>Sy left him the hanging, hanging for his life there.</p><p></p><p>Words Etched on the stomach spelled 'Famine'</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>He swung back to consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He could see the intensity of the anger on the scarred man's face.</p><p></p><p>Sy was still smiling before he blacked out again.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>It was raining. And the thunder was rumbling.</p><p></p><p>16 hours later Sy was standing before a door that read 'Ex-Serviceman'. He found the address of this smoker from the drunkard's phone.</p><p></p><p>Sy knocked on the door and waited for someone to open.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly someone knocked him from behind. It was the person he expected from behind the doors.</p><p></p><p>A thunder boomed from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The smoker inquired who he was, but before Sy could answer the smoker's face turned pale. He had recognized Sy from the bus.</p><p></p><p>Before the man could run, a blow to the back of the neck made his body numb.</p><p></p><p>Moments later he felt like he was moving in some vehicle. Another blow to the head.</p><p></p><p>The Ex-serviceman woke up tied to a bed. He felt some pressure in his limbs. No it was not the ropes with which he was tied by. But they were some kind of metal rings tightly welded on his thighs and ankle. The ring was immovable. It was painful to him. He screamed at the top of his voice.</p><p></p><p>Sy woke up slowly from the couch beside the bed. He Went near him and took an eye dropper and dripped sulphuric acid on his thighs which read 'War'.</p><p></p><p>He placed some kind of book on him and walked out the theatre.</p><p></p><p>The book read 'Acidosis and Alkalosis'.</p><p></p><p>Sykopa knew exactly what would happen.</p><p></p><p>The rings on his ankle and thighs would prevent the blood flow and produce lactic acid. Unless the rings are removed the excess lactic acid produced would slowly poison his blood. And kill him. There would be death. But the pain would make look death like a joke. His legs would be in a battle of agony. He was imagining muscle sprain in every part of the body. It made him earn for more revenge.</p><p></p><p>He walked away with a Raging heart.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>He did not open his eyes. He was not able to.</p><p></p><p>But he heard a ruffling sound, like someone was rolling on the floor.</p><p></p><p>There was a loud Thud and it was silent again.</p><p></p><p>He passed out.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Weeks later he was angry at himself. He was cursing himself for his helplessness. He was not able to find the Third person from the group.</p><p></p><p>He ran the whole scene from the bus in his mind infinite times to grasp any clue about him.</p><p></p><p>And then it struck him. The third person was the driver of the bus. He did not know If he had touched Anonyma or not. But he had to die. He had his part in her death.</p><p></p><p>With a little help from his friend he had the contact information of the Driver.</p><p></p><p>He visited the station where the driver worked. He was told the he had gone to his last shift and would be back within an hour.</p><p></p><p>Sy tracked the driver and got on his bus. He waited out for the crowd to get down.</p><p></p><p>Before the last stop he approached the driver. The bus came to a sudden grinding halt, which threw Sy off guard. Before He could regain his composure the driver was on his knees, praying to Sy.</p><p></p><p>He began to ask forgiveness and begged for his life.</p><p></p><p>Sy didn't even flinch.</p><p></p><p>The driver realized that his end was near. He cried like child who was lost.</p><p></p><p>Sy lifted the driver and hugged him. He took a syringe and injected into the driver's hip. The driver collapsed onto the floor like a tower of cards. The common anesthetic he injected into his hip rendered his legs immovable.</p><p></p><p>Sy took his mallet and sat down near the driver. He calmly took the hands of the driver placed it palm-down on the floor and began to hit each finger. One at a time. Knuckle by knuckle.</p><p></p><p>No heed was paid to the pleas and shouts.</p><p></p><p>Tears were flowing from eyes. Eyes of Sy.</p><p></p><p>He broke every joint in his body with the ease. But there was no bleeding from his body.</p><p></p><p>Sy Took a small blow torch from his duffel and burned 'Conquest' on his Shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The bus was deserted. So was the Driver.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>He was seeing flashes of something. There was two people hugging.</p><p></p><p>Then they were on the floor.</p><p></p><p>Later only one was on the floor.</p><p></p><p>Moments later He felt a sharp sting in his heart and his hands loosen.</p><p></p><p>He slipped again into the void.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>After weeks and weeks of frantic searching he still was not able to find the Youngest one of the rapist. He used all the clues and hints from his mind. His School uniform, his bag, his face, his shoes even his watch. But it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>Years passed. By now Sykopa had killed many others in his search of the juvenile.</p><p></p><p>Now he was a wanted Criminal by the police</p><p></p><p>Sy was almost going backwards from his path. Sykopa had become more of a Psychopathic killer now than an avenger.</p><p></p><p>Until the sudden change of events that would change his life, yet again.</p><p></p><p>It was the monsoons and the season of rain and thunders. This time the gods were abundant in their blessing. The rain was a pleasant gift to everyone but not Sy.</p><p></p><p>His heart was burning with a Fire fueled by rage and anger.</p><p></p><p>It was her 5th anniversary. He was visiting her grave. The ground was muddy from the rain.</p><p></p><p>From a distance, to his shock there was someone else standing before her Tombstone.</p><p></p><p>It was not her parents. Someone else.</p><p></p><p>It was a lone figure. Someone familiar. Someone he could not forget.</p><p></p><p>He ran towards the dark silhouette. The shadow turned away from him and disappeared in split second.</p><p></p><p>Sy heard someone behind him. He turned back to a metal rod. He fell down from the strike and his head hit a grave hard. He fainted instantly.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>He was strapped to a chair by Duct tape but the place was familiar. His Theatre.</p><p></p><p>His body felt weak and he was having difficulty breathing.</p><p></p><p>His face was swollen like a balloon. He was setting into anaphylactic shock.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was dropping in and out. He was barely able to keep up with gravity of the events that was taking place before him.</p><p></p><p>He had underestimated the enemy's skill and strength.</p><p></p><p>He was slowly falling into the limbo of his own mind.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this blunder would be fatal to him.</p><p></p><p>It was true. His whole life was flashing before him. He saw everything clearly like a film out of a cinema scope.</p><p></p><p>His mind slipped</p><p></p><p>He swung back to consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He could see the intensity of the anger on the scarred man's face.</p><p></p><p>Sy was still smiling before he lost blacked out again.</p><p></p><p>He did not open his eyes. He was not able to.</p><p></p><p>But he heard a ruffling sound, like someone was rolling on the floor.</p><p></p><p>There was a loud Thud and it was silent again.</p><p></p><p>He passed out.</p><p></p><p> He was seeing flashes of something. There was two people hugging.</p><p></p><p>Then they were on the floor.</p><p></p><p>Later only one was on the floor.</p><p></p><p>Moments later He felt a sharp sting in his heart and his hands loosen.</p><p></p><p>He slipped again into the void.</p><p></p><p>He heard someone call his name out loud.</p><p></p><p>He bolted upright.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly he could feel his heart pumping faster than an engine.</p><p></p><p>His ears had a ringing sound and everything was bright.</p><p></p><p>Down on the floor moaning was the only person he was chasing for all these years.</p><p></p><p>Sy understood everything in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The last Rapist. The scar in his face reminded of what had happened 5 years ago.</p><p></p><p>With a scream of anguish he jumped at him.</p><p></p><p>They fought with each other and pummeled each other faces with jabs and punches.</p><p></p><p>The once young juvenile overpowered Sy easily.</p><p></p><p>He took the rod and hit Sy's left foot.</p><p></p><p>Barely standing Sy tried to get his hands on something to hit him back. But he got nothing.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if the gods had betrayed him for good.</p><p></p><p>But the rage inside him would not let him lose that easily.</p><p></p><p>He lunged at the Scarface and elbowed him in his stomach.</p><p></p><p>They hit the floor. Sy heard someone call out to him.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively he caught the Meat hooks that were thrown to him.</p><p></p><p>He pierced the Stomach of Scarface and tore him apart.</p><p></p><p>It was over.</p><p></p><p>It was done.</p><p></p><p>With the blood from the dead body he wrote 'Death' on the forehead of the Scarface.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Someone hugged him by behind.</p><p></p><p>It took him a moment to realize that it was a hug and not an attack.</p><p></p><p>He turned around to witness the most shocking Revelation.</p><p></p><p>It was Anonyma.</p><p></p><p>Or so he thought.</p><p></p><p>It was Perdu.</p><p></p><p>The Twin of Anonyma.</p><p></p><p>She explained how she was also tracking the rapists with a desire to see their lives end.</p><p></p><p>And also how she had tailed Scarface from the grave till here.</p><p></p><p>She was also the one who injected adrenaline to save him from his anaphylaxis.</p><p></p><p>Sy's mind was trying to cope up with all that had happened.</p><p></p><p>Whatever it maybe he was happy with whatever that had happened.</p><p></p><p>His mind was like a calm ocean now.</p><p></p><p>Though the city was revolting his mind was not.</p><p></p><p>He burned his theatre down.</p><p></p><p>And they walked into the now set Sun.</p><p></p><p>Let us hope this would've happened in an alternate universe</p><p></p>
