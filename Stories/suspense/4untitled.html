<h4 style="text-align:justify;font-family:Nyala;font-size:1.3em;color:#000;">

<p>It was village that would be known for its scenic beauty, if it was at all known. This story starts in a quaint little village where nothing out of the ordinary ever happened. It was one of those villages that were almost engulfed by thick forests that you would almost miss it when driving by. But if at all you did stop, to smell the roses (or to attend to Nature’s call), you would see that in this village ignored by the maddening world was so much serene beauty that you could forget the world and all the worries that came with it and just stand there admiring the beauty, day in and day out. The nearest civilization, as per the modern man’s definitions, was several hundred miles away, making it, some would say jokingly, a perfect hideout for a serial murderer. But of course, not even a serial murderer would be able to kill in peace surrounded by so much peace, as ironic as it is.</p><p>To such a village came a rather rude shock. One summer night, as the whole village was deep in slumber, a speeding car, a red convertible to be precise, lost control and rammed onto a poor ol’ live oak tree. The tree survived the crash, true to its name, but the car was merely the humble remains of its previous self. And the owner of the car was lost beyond recognition. And so the case of the convertible crash was closed as an accident. Lessons were taught to the village young adults about the various aspects of safe driving, no speeding, no drunken driving and, if possible, no driving at all. All was set to be forgotten soon, except every night the village folks would hear the sound of a crash and no evidence of one by morning.</p><p>All the villagers pooled in their available human resources to help the police department solve this unusual mystery. But alas, no clues were to be found. It was then suggested that they could take turns being a night guard, that way there would be someone who could witness the mystery giving the much needed insight. Once again human resources were pooled in and night guards were appointed. Hours passed leading onto the next morning, nothing. The next day, nothing. The following week, nothing. Soon, the villagers gave up on solving the mystery. “Not that anyone is getting hurt that we know of”, they reasoned. Soon normalcy was restored. So much that the sounds of car crashes at night were considered part of normalcy.</p><p>Meanwhile in a city, 457 miles away from the said village, small children were going missing irregularly but consistently. The real mystery was not that children were going missing, it was that it was not a regular kidnapping or murder. No ransom was requested of the parents and every Saturday a picture of the all the missing children till said date holding that day’s newspaper was sent to the parents anonymously. It was a strange kind of evil that was blooming in the city and nobody knew what to do about it. </p><p>Back in the village, even as the rest of the village began forgetting the whole chain of incidents, one particular police officer could not. He continued to investigate unofficially and without anybody’s knowledge in his own unorthodox methods. He would often trek into the forest hoping to find some clue that would lead to his discovering the logic behind the mystery. On one such trek, he realized he walked rather deep into the woods and as dusk was nearing he decided to turn back after another unsuccessful day of trying to find clues. Just as he was about to turn back he noticed smoke which seemed to be coming from a chimney. ‘Who in his right mind’, he thought, ‘would be living this deep into the woods?’ Somewhere inside some part of him said this was somehow related to the mystery he ached to solve. So he did what any policeman should have done if they found themselves in such a situation, he hid around the corner of the house and waited patiently for its occupant(s) to leave so that he could conduct his investigations. Soon enough, a man dressed as a clown accompanied by another of the missing children walked out and drove away in a red convertible, much like the one that was in the crash so long ago except for all the damages from the crash. With his doubts building up inside him stronger and stronger, he broke into the house. It seemed to be a taxidermists’ workshop. And it was no game animals being stuffed, it were children. These children he recognized from the news. These were the missing children from the city. Before he could even begin to think of a theory, he was knocked cold by the clown. He awoke to find himself tied to a column and a rather nervous clown seemingly talking to thin air about how he’d seen too much.</p><p>“Oh, you are awake now”, said the clown in the sweetest voice he could conjure, “Normally I wouldn’t do this. But you leave me no choice. You have seen too much, sir. This shall not pass without implications!” and with these words and one blow to his head with a shovel, he killed the police officer, still tied to the column. The night had set in. One meaningful look into his watch, as if to say it is getting late, the clown dragged the child for a walk deeper into the woods, still looking as glee as a clown would be.</p><p>Scared by the turn of events, the child said “It’s so dark, Mr. Clown. I’m scared!” barely able to speak with the trembling fear that gripped him.</p><p>To which the clown laughed, a merry kind of laughter, and said, “Cheer up, young fella! You’re much better off than I. I have to walk all the way back with no living soul for company”</p><p>The End.</p><p></p>
