<p>"Just throw the bait and wait son, he will come to you", Stein remembered his fathers words from the fishing day festival.</p><p></p><p>He was slowly able to see and move, he worked his muscles at full speed and started running at Isaac. he swiftly picked up the sharp piece of glass that was floating and jumped at Issac, fractions later,</p><p>the next time wave hit them.</p><p></p><p>An hour earlier...</p><p></p><p>"How did he manage to set it off?!", Stein wracked his brain over and over, he went over every possibility of how it could happen and how Issac would try to escape its consequences.</p><p></p><p>He knew there was only one possibility for all this to happen. He must have embedded a quantum Chip to his brain like himself.</p><p></p><p>"He must be beating his brain to understand how I managed to detonate the CHRONO BOMB.", Issac mentally appreciated himself for what he had done.</p><p>Though it was a suicide mission of stealing Stein's Blueprints for the quantum chip, it was a  99.9 %  possibility of death remodelling it for himself.</p><p>The feeling of realising that they were the only people who were surviving the Time-Space Disruption caused by the bomb must have given him goosebumps if the time had not slowed down.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was mere survival, because he knew he had to make his move before the next wave hit them or else he would be slowed down again quicker since every time the wave hit them, the time or distance between the waves would decrease exponentially thus making it even difficult for them to react when time flows normally.</p><p></p><p>Stein immediately regretted creating the quantum chip and the "The Literal Time bomb", as they called it at the lab. Stein knew that a radius of 5 miles were caught in the Time-Space disruption.</p><p></p><p>"The quantum chip is your amulet to make yourself all powerful god and the Time bomb is your super weapon Stein, pray it doesn't fall into wrong hands", words of  Nikol echoed in his mind She was his Lab partner and Partner in life.</p><p></p><p>He was previously slowed on his way towards the direction of the bomb by the wave that hit him, but thankfully the quantum chip that is embedded in his brain allowed him to stay outside of the Time-Space Fabric. He had won his Nobel Prize for this discovery.</p><p>Time began to return to its normal state slowly.</p><p></p><p>Issac was slowly able to see things, he had only one thought "I must get out of this place and as far as possible to escape from the Permanent Time collapse". But of course he knew it was not going to be easy with Stein on his tail. He moved as fast as he could towards he door. he waded through the rubble that was still floating from the time disruption.</p><p></p><p>Stein ran as fast as he could with all his might, and he spotted him, "Stop right there Issac!. I will eventually catch up to you".</p><p></p><p>Issac have a mild laugh and retorted,"Don't you still realise that I also have my own version of your quantum chip?".</p><p>"How did they even give this guy a Nobel Prize?", Issac rolled his eyes.</p><p>"You were never bright in school either Steiny".</p><p>He raised his gun an shot at Stein, the first one missed him by an inch and the second one Slowed down before it could reach Stein's face.</p><p>The next wave had hit them. it was sooner that they thought.</p><p></p><p>If it was not for the disruption he would have had a hole in his head right now. Stein ironically thanked for the time wave that had hit now.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I have crappy aim!", thought Issac to himself.</p><p></p><p>Stein Took in the picture and he knew that bullet would stay there long if he doesn't move next time.</p><p>His brain was working rapidly and he was calculating every scenery possible for the next few moments</p><p></p><p>Issac was hoping that the bullet would hit him. Time began to unreel slowly, but faster this time.</p><p></p><p>In a Matrix-Special-effects style movement Stein had thought up a scene of evading the bullet, but he knew it would impede his further movement.</p><p>He Slyly Tilted his head and let the bullet slowly accelerate beside him. Now he moved rapidly towards the glass that was floating nearby.</p><p></p><p>Issac was bewildered at the speed of Stein's movement. He had to escape.</p><p>the next wave had hit them even quicker than before.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of both Issac and Stein was of Pure shock.</p><p>it had dawned upon them that they had only one chance for them to escape or react.</p><p>After the next wave, the disruption would reach its saturation and they would be stuck in the time lapse infinitely.</p><p></p><p>It was beginning to return to normal. Stein forced his body to move opposing the time flow, every bit of his muscle was under strain and was screaming for release. He began moving with a burst of speed at the glass shard, he picked it up, and clutched it strongly. he now directed himself at Issac who was surprised at his swiftness. With an shout of angst Stein jumped at Issac "Isaaaaaccc!"</p><p>The Glass shard had made an incision on the skin directly above Issac's heart. Blood was slowly seeping out.</p><p>The Next wave hit them.</p><p></p><p>Fractions before...</p><p></p><p>A shot was heard. Tip of the bullet had already entered Stein's chest. The blood splashed and froze. The Next wave hit them</p><p></p><p>They were stuck in the Time Lapse.</p><p>But Fate had other plans. It always has.</p><p></p><p>Another wave hit them.</p><p></p><p>Both were surprised. Time began to reverse.</p><p></p><p>Issac had entered the saferoom where the Chrono bomb was kept.</p><p>He used the fingerprints he stole from Stein's blueprints to set off the bomb.</p><p></p><p>The bomb ticked off and a voice played from the bomb, "Do not turn back if you want your face to be unharmed"</p><p></p><p>Stein landed a punch on his face, instantly breaking Issac's nose.</p><p>The police that had arrived there apprehended Issac. "How is this possible?!", cried Issac, stupefied.</p><p></p><p>"I love surprises, don't you dear Issac?", said Stein with a smug.</p><p></p><p>Little did Issac know that his version of quantum chip was not guarded against reverse time flow.</p><p>Stein had Improved his quantum chip after it was stolen which allowed his brain to stay intact. The bomb was dismantled the pieces were destroyed carefully.</p><p></p><p>After all Stein did as his Father had advised him ,"Just throw the bait and wait son, he will come to you".</p><p></p><p></p>
