<h4 style="text-align:justify;font-family:Nyala;font-size:1.3em;color:#000;">

<p>It was a hot, humid day. The summer was at its peak. I shifted in my seat uneasily, trying in vain to obstruct the rays of sun towards my face. April had never been this hot my entire life. Or maybe I was just getting too old to travel anymore. It was a long, rough drive. There was hardly anyone in the bus, except for a young man. He reminded me of those good old times. Times when I was all energetic and jubilant. It’s interesting how, no matter how well you plan your life, destiny almost always has other plans for you. I was soon lost into dreaming about the past, when I was woken up by the bus conductor. I had reached the place. I struggled to get up, with my knee cap tightening around my leg every time I move it. I somehow managed to get down the bus. I had a few sips of water from the bottle that I had carried with me. </p><p>I could notice numerous changes since the last time I was here. I spotted at least five times as many houses as there were before. Roads had been laid out in tar. All the Rickshaws were gone and autos had taken their place instead. The aroma of mud and rain that was always there was replaced by the dirty smoke from the vehicles. There were certainly more buildings and less of the green cover. No one would believe now that it was once an agricultural village. The municipality limits had been extended and the Panchayat wasn’t responsible for management anymore. I probably wouldn’t have recognized the place, but thanks to the reassuring hoarding that welcomed the visitors. All these changes made me feel sick. Uncertainty settled in, and I started to worry if I came all the way here for nothing. I cleared my thoughts and started walking. I knew I had to walk around 3 miles, but my heart was just too impatient. </p><p>I couldn’t help but think about the past few days. The sudden longing, how I couldn’t concentrate on anything at all, all those times when I day dreamt and I wondered why. I wondered what made me come here after 21 years. Anyone who had watched me all these years would probably have thought that I was some kind of a self-control Guru. Well, I was, to some extent. Until just a few days back. It was really hard initially. It took huge loads of perseverance to not come here, for not just a day or two, but twenty one years. </p><p>I had spent the happiest days of my life around this place. I thought about the first time my mother brought me here, the first friends I made, the kulfi ice creams that were my favorite, my grandmas beautiful house, her sumptuous food, countless nights I fell asleep in her lap, the innately kind village people who loved me like I was their own, the annual village festivals, the Panchayat cricket tournaments, the bicycle rides around the village, the Iyappan temple, the long river side walks, the umpteen first day first shows at Alankar theatre, the school that my grandpa built, my first job as a teacher there, my first kiss, my first love, my marriage. All the memories found their way back to me. They came gushing in, and surprisingly they were all vivid, like they happened yesterday. In what feels like forever, I missed all this. I felt pain. I felt lost. I wanted to travel back in time. I wanted to relive and relish every minute of this part of my life. I wished to redo everything, and start all over again. The pain that had been augmenting in my knee finally got my attention. I bent down to soothe it a little and when I got up, I saw it.</p><p>The leathery old banyan tree. At that moment, I lost all the uncertainty I had. It was still there. It was just as healthy and green as it was 21 years back. Standing tall and gigantic with its dark green leaves spreading all around it. I was ecstatic to see it, to finally realize that the tree, my tree, wasn’t cut down after all. It meant the world to me. It was near this tree where I first met Kaushi when we both were 6 years old. It was here in its shadow that I shared my first kiss with her at 16. It was right here that I proposed to marry her at 21. It was under the vast expanse of this tree where I happily married her one fine day. The happiest day of my life. I slowly walked towards it. I remembered how we used to run around the tree and play with such delight when we were kids. I remembered us sitting down the tree every evening in the summers, holding each other’s hands. I remembered the big fight that we had under this tree and our break up. I remembered the five lonely days that I spent crying at the bottom of this tree. I remembered how the next day, she came running to me and we hugged and kissed each other and how we ended up never fighting ever again, right till the end. It was all so vivid. As I came closer to the tree, I was able to see our names carved into its mammoth trunk. As I touched it, tears stared flowing down my eyes. I let myself cry this time. I cried all my emotions out. I cried to the last drop of tear in me.</p><p>I missed Kaushi. Even after all these years after her death, I never stopped loving her any lesser. If anything, I loved her more every single day. I had controlled myself for a long period of time. I somehow managed to not come here for all these years. I finally let it go. I let all the grief fall out. I felt mixed emotions right then. I was depressed about my wife’s loss. I was angry over destiny to have done that to me. I was mad on God to have taken my love away from me. It felt like yesterday. I remembered she lying in her hospital bed, bravely fighting the ductal carcinoma cancer. I remembered how she always talked about getting cured of it and having a beautiful future with me. I felt such revulsion for God. </p><p>My face went numb. I couldn’t feel my eyes anymore. I felt lifeless. I turned my head to the left to find the river Chambal. This was where I emptied her ashes the last time I was here. I walked towards the water. My head was blank. My heart was heavy. I started breathing deeply as I neared the water. I let myself fall down to stand on my knees. I didn’t feel the pain I should have. My hands trembled as I reached for the water. I put both my hands into the flowing river, took some water and drank it, spilling almost half of it while taking it to my mouth. It had a divine taste to it. Plain water never tasted so good. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the sip. I felt a hand on my right shoulder. I knew it was her. I opened my eyes and turned to my right to find her standing there, near me, looking ever so gorgeous.  </p><p>‘I love you, Raju…’ she whispered. </p><p>Those four words reverberated in my ears. I couldn’t hear the river flowing, I couldn’t hear the birds chirping. I couldn’t hear the frogs croaking. There was utter silence. The nature muted itself to let me grasp in what my Kaushi said. Everything around me slowly darkened. I fell down to my right, as I heard her words one last time.</p>
