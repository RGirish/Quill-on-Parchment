<p>Jim was lying on the ground in the corner of the room shaking from head to toe. A machine was whirring at the centre emitting out a faint white light. His eyes were looking at the machine expectantly hoping and praying for some miracle. He seemed desperate. Tools and other fancy looking gadgets and gizmos littered the floor. Suddenly he heard a noise somewhere far off. His heart beat started to soar. He had been expecting this ever since he set up camp here. He usually never stayed at the same place on consecutive nights but he had to for the past one week to execute his grand escape plan. He had chosen a random small house in the city to not attract too much attention. Yet it was inevitable that someone may break in. He heard the distinct sound of someone breaking open the front door. He clenched the iron rod firmly in his hand. The machine started becoming brighter and brighter. It seemed as if it was charging with power. He was afraid the brightness may betray his whereabouts. He frantically got up and placed one hand on the machine while trying to shield the light from escaping the room with his body. Any second now…he thought. He heard the footsteps creaking under the sound of something heavy. Then silence, it was like a lull before a storm. It was now or never. Everything happened in a fraction of a second. The door burst open, its weak lock giving away and something tall and bulky stood at the doorway. It was made of a metal exoskeleton, had glowing eyes and a poker face expression.</p><p> ‘Back off!’ he yelled at the animatron.</p><p>‘Professor Jim Anderson, the union wants the machine. Hand the machine over.’ said the animatron, the gears in its throat whirring at full speed.</p><p>‘Tell the union, over my dead body.’ Jim spat at the robot</p><p>‘Message sent. Reply received: “As you wish professor.”’ replied the animatron. The latter part of the sentence was said in a high pitched reedy voice. </p><p>Meanwhile the machine grew brighter, the core now looked like a heat haze.</p><p>‘Any moment now.’ Jim muttered to himself.</p><p>The animatron aimed the gun at the machine, the gun was made of calcium and the bullet of steel. The machine began humming. The animatron shot the bullet. With a loud scream Jim dived in front of the machine and there was a burst of light. It enveloped the animatron and started racing outwards toward the other houses in the vicinity. Everything that the light touched disintegrated into a fine dust powder. It was like the apocalypse. Suddenly the light stopped. It retreated back into the machine faster than its release. Within a fraction of a second the machine and its creator disappeared. All that was left behind was the fine powder of the animatron that once stood. </p><p>On a cold deserted plain on an unknown land Jim woke up gasping.</p><p>‘Dead…Alive…where?’ he wheezed.</p><p>He spotted the machine a few steps away and crawled his way towards it. The machine was small. It looked like a small box with strange pieces sticking out of it. The machine was made of metal and the cracks glowed blue.</p><p>‘What happened here?’ muttered Jim.</p><p> He looked around the plain and spotted few yellow pillars in the distance. He picked up the box and walked towards the yellow pillar. </p><p>‘Until when will my luck last? How close am I to death? Somehow this place is more dangerous than the one I had just left.’ he thought while he was walking.</p><p>The yellow pillars in the distance grew bigger. There were towers built by intelligent beings. The city was dotted with blue sea anemone like plants but there were no people. </p><p>Suddenly a knife was placed on his throat. A slow voice hissed in his ear. Jim was frantic. He couldn’t see his attacker nor understand him. Thankfully the machine translated the hisses.</p><p>‘What are you?’ it rasped.</p><p>‘I am Jim, a human.’ replied Jim which the machine translated for his attacker to understand.</p><p>‘How did you come to Nova?’ the captor hissed.</p><p>‘By my machine…where is Nova?’ asked Jim.</p><p>‘In Iris.’ it replied.</p><p>‘Galaxy?’ asked Jim.</p><p>‘Andromeda.’ came the reply.</p><p>  Jim had done it. He had created a wormhole and transported himself to another galaxy. </p><p>‘Andromeda…I am so pleased.’ said Jim absent-mindedly forgetting his circumstances.</p><p>‘And so are we.’ hissed back the voice full of dark pleasure.</p><p>‘Welcome to Iris.’ hissed another voice and Jim turned to face the King.</p><p>The journey had just begun.  </p><p></p>
